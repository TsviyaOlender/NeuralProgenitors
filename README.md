# NeuralProgenitors
This respiratory includes the scripts that were used to create the data in <b>"Neural Progenitors as a Novel Pathogenic Mechanism in Microcephaly"</b>.
The scripts:<br>
cortical_analysis.R<br>
rostal_analysis.R <br>
were used to analyze the scRNAseq data, using Seurat.<br>
The script read_human_embryonic_atlas.R was used to process the data of Braun et al. (2023) Science (downloaded from https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/collections/4d8fed08-2d6d-4692-b5ea-464f1d072077) and to create the scRNA reference matrix for cibersort bulk deconvolution.<br>
The script label_transfer.R was used to annotate the cortical scRNAseq against the data of Braun et al.
